#### Description
My project is *Sticky Notes* where you can add notes and keep them on the page  and access them at any time you wish.I used local storage to save  notes. So even if you close the tab or refresh the page they will not be deleted. You can add as many notes as you want.It is possible to edit or totaly remove any of them.I used flex-wrap to make them nisely layout on the page having line between each other.The notes also responsive for any size of the screen. I included markdown library in the text input.
You can check the syntax of markdown library if you wish to modify your text with it.
