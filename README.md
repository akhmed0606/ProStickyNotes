# Pro Sticky Notes

<a href="https://akhmed0606.github.io/stickynotes.github.io/" class="button">Live Demo</a>

#### Description
My project is *Sticky Notes App* where you can add notes and keep them on the page  and access them at any time you wish.I used local storage to save  notes. So even if you close the tab or refresh the page they will not be deleted. You can add as many notes as you want.It is possible to edit or totaly remove any of them.I used flex-wrap to make them nisely layout on the page having line between each other.The notes also responsive for any size of the screen. I included markdown library in the text input.It is very siple to use.
You can check the syntax of markdown library if you wish to modify your text with it.

Since there are a lot of similar projects out there I've desided to add some features to make this sticky notes special and useful.
I started this project when I was on week 8. Having learned front end development along with this cousrse I came up with the ideas to modify my project.I checked out other sticky note apps to see what I could do something special to make this web app helpful and easy to use. And I noticed that most of them do not have voise recognition in the notes directly you will have to call it outside of the sticky note.Other thing I noticed is they do not  use drawing feature for sticky notes. I found if I implement this idea it might be very useful to draw in the note your ideas which you can translate into a text note just by clicking add note button. It is also possible to have draw sticky note and texting one on the page at the same time.
