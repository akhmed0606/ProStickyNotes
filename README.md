# Pro Sticky Notes

#### Description
My project is *Sticky Notes* where you can add notes and keep them on the page and access them at any time you wish. I used local storage to save notes. So even if you close the tab or refresh the page they will not be deleted. Users can add as many notes as they wish. They can edit or totaly remove any of them. I used flex-wrap to create a nice layout. The notes are fully responsive. I included markdown library in the text input.
You can check the syntax of markdown library if you wish to modify your text with it.
